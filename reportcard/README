We use two inputs: 
* input3p.json gives information about third-party trackers and their behaviors
* input1p.json give information about which third parties are present on which first-party site

3pReportCard.py produces report card data for third parties, as a json file
1pReportCard.py produces report card data for first parties, as a json file
