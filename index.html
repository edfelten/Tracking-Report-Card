            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Summary of extension:</p>
            <p>This extension shows the privacy grade (from A to F) for
              most sites that you visit, based on what they do with
              their users' data. These grades are based on how well or
              how poorly that sites utilize their users' data.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We give stellar grades to 1st-party sites that: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>do not allow a large amount of 3rd party networks to
                be called on their site (and do not let a lot of 3rd
                party networks to download tracking cookies on the
                visitor's browser)</li>
              <li>honor both &#8220;opt-out&#8221; cookies and &#8220;do not track&#8221;
                requests</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We give poor grades to 1st-party sites that: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>call a lot of 3rd party networks and then those 3rd
                party networks download multiple tracking cookies on the
                user's browser</li>
              <li>call 3rd-party networks which have poor quality scores
                themselves (because the 3rd parties do not allow for
                cookie opt out or do not honor DNT requests) </li>
              <li>continue to track users online behavior even after the
                users opt-out of online tracking through the use of
                &#8220;opt-out&#8221; cookies </li>
              <li>continue to track users online behavior if the user
                turns on the &#8220;do not track&#8221; option in their browsers</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Methodology of generating the
              grades:</p>
            <p>We crawled the top 500 Alexa sites on 4/14/12 and we
              logged all cookie downloads that resulted from those
              crawls. We performed three different crawls: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>first, with a clean-sate browser without any opt-out
                cookies or do not track requests</li>
              <li>second, with the BeefTaco extension active (which
                downloads most opt-out cookies) </li>
              <li>third, with the "do not track" request option selected
                in the browser</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We performed these different crawls to analyze if the
              sites honored opt out cookies and/or &#8220;do not track&#8221;
              requests from the headers. Based on these crawls, we
              graded the top 500 Alexa sites and relevant 3rd-party
              networks. Raw data from the crawls will be located at
              trackingcookie.info in the future for reference.<br>
