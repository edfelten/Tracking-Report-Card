# Mozmill Tests #

Mozmill tests are written in JavaScript. They can be run using the Mozmill
add-on for Firefox, or the Mozmill command line client. Once you have either of
these installed, you can contribute by running the tests, raising any issues you
find, and writing new tests!

See the 'Getting Started' page on QMO for instructions on installing and running
Mozmill Tests - http://quality.mozilla.org/docs/mozmill/getting-started/
